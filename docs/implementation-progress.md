# Implementation progress

Phase 1 is on `main` at `66b3624` on GitHub. Phase 2A access-control design passed a **static security gate** on 2026-10-14. The migration has **not** been applied to remote Supabase. Phase 2B has not started.

## Phase 2A security gate (latest)

### Static SQL / security review

| Area                           | Result                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax and dependency order    | No issues found in manual review (foundation migration first, then access control).                                                     |
| Grants and RLS                 | All eight tables: RLS enabled + forced; `authenticated` has select-only via policies; no client insert/update/delete policies.          |
| SECURITY DEFINER               | Public RPCs and `app_private.*` helpers use `set search_path = ''`.                                                                     |
| Privilege escalation           | Self-target blocked on roles, active status, administered profile, branch assignments.                                                  |
| Bootstrap                      | `bootstrap_initial_admin` granted to `service_role` only, not `authenticated`; confirmation phrase required; fails if any Admin exists. |
| Godown Manager verification    | `stock.verify` granted only to Godown Manager.                                                                                          |
| Adjustment posting             | `stock.adjustment.post` (Godown Manager) separate from `stock.adjustment.approve_exceptional` (Admin).                                  |
| Store Keeper                   | `stock.count_assist` only — not verification owner.                                                                                     |
| Delivery Person transit damage | Documented as unresolved; `damage.record` **not** granted.                                                                              |
| 50-unit configuration seed     | Treated as **provisional placeholder**, not an approved business rule.                                                                  |

### Defects found and fixed in this gate

1. **`assign_user_branch`** — now rejects unknown or inactive operating sites before insert.

### Remaining security concerns (accepted for dev apply with review)

1. **No local migration execution** — Docker Desktop daemon was not running; `npx supabase status` failed. SQL was **not** machine-applied in this environment.
2. **`service_role` bypasses RLS** — Supabase platform behavior; mitigated by keeping the key out of the repo and browser.
3. **`has_permission` executable by any authenticated user** — returns only the caller’s own permission state; acceptable for app use, minor probing surface.
4. **`grant usage on schema app_private to authenticated`** — required for executing granted functions in that schema.
5. **RPC and RLS not smoke-tested with JWT roles** — schema apply and advisors passed locally; authenticated RPC paths were not exercised end-to-end.

### Local migration validation (Docker running, 2026-10-14)

| Command                            | Result                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx supabase start`               | **Passed** — `20261014000000_foundation.sql` and `20261014150000_access_control.sql` applied.                     |
| `npx supabase db lint --local`     | **Passed** — no schema errors.                                                                                    |
| `npx supabase db reset --local`    | **Passed** — clean reapply.                                                                                       |
| `npx supabase db advisors --local` | **Passed** — no issues.                                                                                           |
| Stock permission spot-check        | Godown Manager has verify/post/request/report; Admin has approve_exceptional; Store Keeper has count_assist only. |

**SQL validation passed** on local Supabase. Remote project `ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup` was not modified.

### Application validation (actual)

| Command             | Result                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed                     |
| `npm run lint`      | Passed                     |
| `npm test`          | Passed — 6 files, 12 tests |
| `npm run build`     | Passed                     |

## Safe apply to development Supabase (when approved)

Do **not** apply until stakeholders accept `docs/access-control.md` and open items below.

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Hash\Desktop\Hashdev\sherlyos
# Optional but recommended when Docker works:
# npx supabase init   # only if config.toml is added later
# npx supabase start
# npx supabase db reset   # local dry-run only

# Link dev project (access token in environment, not in repo):
# npx supabase link --project-ref ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup

# Apply to linked development database:
# npx supabase db push

# One-time in SQL editor (postgres / dashboard), after Auth user exists:
# select app_private.bootstrap_initial_admin('<auth-user-id>'::uuid, 'create-initial-administrator');
```

After apply: assign roles and sites via `assign_user_role`, `create_branch`, `assign_user_branch`. Verify RLS manually with test JWTs in the SQL editor or a small script.

## Gate recommendation

**READY** to apply the reviewed migrations to the **development** Supabase project via `npx supabase db push` after `supabase link`. Local apply and lint succeeded.

**NOT READY** for production until dev apply, bootstrap, RPC smoke tests, and business sign-off on provisional configuration values are complete.

## Development cloud deployment attempt (2026-10-14)

- Target project from `.env.example`, docs, and code: `ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup`.
- `.env` and `.env.local` exist locally and are git-ignored. Access token is present in `.env` (presence only checked, value never printed).
- `npx supabase link --project-ref ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup` **failed** with `LinkProjectStatusError`: the token's account lacks privileges for that project endpoint.
- `npx supabase projects list` with the same token shows only project `b2bintelli` (`ivmgjtinhpyvtsogpjyt`). Target `ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup` is **not visible** to this token.
- Remote migration history could **not** be checked. `db push --dry-run` was **not** run because linking is a prerequisite.
- No remote database was modified. No Admin bootstrap was run. No role/RPC/JWT tests against cloud were run.
- Fresh app checks in this pass: typecheck passed, lint passed, Vitest 12/12 passed, production build passed (894.99 kB JS warning unchanged).

## Re-check with corrected token (2026-10-14)

- `npx supabase projects list` now shows only `sherlysos` (`ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup`, `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, `ap-northeast-2`, created `2026-10-14`). Target confirmed.
- `npx supabase link --project-ref ypkfondrkhkydkgovwup` succeeded.
- `npx supabase migration list --linked` shows both local migrations with empty remote history: `20261014000000` and `20261014150000` are pending, nothing else.
- `npx supabase db push --linked --dry-run` would push exactly `20261014000000_foundation.sql` and `20261014150000_access_control.sql`. Remote database was **not** modified. Actual push awaits explicit approval.

## Cloud apply + JWT validation (2026-10-14, after approval)

- `npx supabase db push --linked` applied `20261014000000_foundation.sql` and `20261014150000_access_control.sql` to development. `migration list --linked` now shows both as applied.
- Created six throwaway Auth users (`phase2a.*@example.com`, email-confirmed, server-side Admin API). Trigger created one profile each with **zero** roles. The pre-existing account also has no roles: no auto-admin anywhere.
- `app_private.bootstrap_initial_admin` ran once via owner SQL (SQL-editor equivalent): succeeded. Repeat run correctly failed with `initial administrator already exists`.
- Signed in as all six users (real JWTs) — **34/34 checks passed**:
  - Admin assigned the other five roles via `assign_user_role`; self-assign rejected (`you cannot change your own roles`).
  - Salesperson granting Admin rejected (`not authorized`).
  - Admin created site `godown_main`, assigned the Godown Manager; godown sees 1 site, unassigned salesperson sees 0; unknown-branch and self-branch changes rejected.
  - Admin reads audit rows; salesperson reads zero rows; direct `user_roles` insert denied (`permission denied`).
  - Matrix confirmed: godown has `stock.verify` + report/request/post, Admin has `approve_exceptional`, store has `count_assist` only (no `stock.verify`), delivery has no `damage.record`.
  - Threshold key reads `50` (**provisional placeholder, not an approved rule**).
  - `update_own_profile` works; self-deactivation rejected.
- Cleanup: all six throwaway users deleted (profiles/roles cascaded; 8 audit rows preserved as append-only proof). Temp credentials destroyed. One test site row (`godown_main`) remains in dev `branches`; delete it or keep it as a dev fixture.
- Godown Manager verification ownership and routine-post vs exceptional-approve split hold as documented. Transit-damage grant still withheld.

## Outstanding business decisions

1. Replace provisional `stock.adjustment.exceptional_absolute_units` seed after formal approval.
2. Delivery Person + `damage.record` for transit (DMG-05) — still unresolved.
3. INR-based exceptional thresholds — deferred.
4. Real Admin provisioning: run the documented bootstrap for the actual administrator account, then assign staff and sites.

## Git

Phase 2A is committed and pushed (see log). `.env`, `.env.local`, and `dist/` stay ignored. No secrets committed.
